## Learning Objectives

|                           |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Learning Objectives:**  |
| Create a code repository with git.   |
| Set up a documented remote copy of the repository on github. |
| Branch the repository to edit, and then merge changes. |
| Work collaboratively. |

In this module we will learn the basics of the version control software git, and how to set up a remote code repository on the web service [GitHub](https://github.com). 

These chapters will be somewhat sparse, as you will be referred to existing training material in HuskyCT. 

Many (perhaps most?) people find Git to be a bit confusing at times. You should prepare for that possibility, and know that you may need to refer to documentation or seek help.
