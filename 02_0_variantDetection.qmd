## Learning Objectives

|                           |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Learning Objectives:**  |
| Conduct quality control analysis of raw and mapped data specific to variant detection.  |
| Identify variants and genotype samples against a reference genome. |
| Manipulate the VCF format |
| Apply strategies for filtering problematic variants. |
| Assess variant call-set quality. |
| Conduct basic variant effect annotation. |


In this module we will work through a basic variant detection and genotyping workflow. We'll cover quality control at various stages of the analysis, and use a few different variant callers so that we can compare results. We'll also cover basic variant effect annotation. The basic scripts we're going to work through can be found at [this github repository](https://github.com/isg-certificate/variants).
