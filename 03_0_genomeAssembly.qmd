## Learning Objectives

|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Learning Objectives:**  |
| Conduct quality control analysis of raw data specific to genome assembly. |
| Estimate genome size from unassembled reads. |
| Assemble a genome sequence. |
| Scaffold a genome sequence using Hi-C data. |
| Estimate the completeness, correctness, and contiguity of an assembled genome.|

In this module we'll go over the essentials of a genome assembly workflow. We'll cover QC steps (pretty sparse here) and do some initial estimation of some features of the genome using k-mers. We will then assemble a haplotype phased genome using PacBio HiFi data and Hi-C data from Arima. We'll scaffold the assembly using the Hi-C data and do some QC steps on the assembly.
